Interview code Q's
==================
A place to keep a list of some questions I encountered in interviews while looking for internships.

* longest palindromic substring Q (added: Feb 19/18)
  * implementation based on dynamic programming
    * checks if first and last character of a substr are the same and uses previous results to check if the characters contained within is a palindrome
  * current runtime: O(n^2)
* coinbag & amount Q (added: Feb 17/18)
  * current implemention is recursive, could be optimized further to be pseudo-linear
  * current runtime: O(n^2)
